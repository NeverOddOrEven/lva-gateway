## Overview

Azure IoT Edge is a fully managed service that delivers cloud intelligence locally by deploying and running

- Custom Logic
- Azure Services
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

directly on cross-platform IoT devices. Run your IoT solution securely and at scaleâ€”whether in the cloud or offline.

This article lists the steps to deploy an Ubuntu **16.04 LTS** virtual machine with the Azure IoT Edge runtime installed.

## Azure Market Place Offering

Use a preconfigured virtual machine to get started quickly, and easily automate and scale your IoT Edge testing.

This **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS** based virtual machine will install the latest Azure IoT Edge runtime and its dependencies on startup, and makes it easy to connect to your IoT Hub.

1. Validation process happens and a web page is presented. Click **Create** button.

1. Deployment completes in around 3 minutes.

1. Click on **Go To Resource** button

1. Note the Private IP address, you will need it to setup the **rtsp** stream URL

1. Use PuTTY to connect to the Linux machine using SSH, you will be prompted for username and password

1. Run with elevated privilege, enter **sudo su -** and press **enter**. You will be prompted to enter your password.

1. Update the IoT Edge security daemon and runtime to the latest.

    You will need to run the following commands as an administrator
    (sudo):

    ```bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install libiothsm iotedge`
    iotedge version
    ```

    Verify the version on your device by using the command `iotedge version`.

    The Lva Edge Gateway has been developed using version 1.0.9.

## Prepare the Edge device's data directory

> [!NOTE]
> This step needs to precede connecting the Edge to IoT Central, because the modules depend on the data directory and on startup they load the state from state.json
>

In this reference implementation, we are keeping some configuration under the directory
/data/storage

On the Edge gateway, Create 2 directories from root (you need elevated privileges) and give Read and and Write permissions to these directories

```bash
mkdir -p data/storage
mkdir -p data/media
chmod -R 777 /data
```

Copy you development state.json file into the newly created storage directory.
PuTTY has the utility [pscp](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to transfer files securely

You need to start a Command shell from your development machine, locate the file and transfer to the unix machine

Usage
`pscp [options] source user@host:target`

Example
`pscp state.json iot@40.121.209.246:/data/storage/state.json`

## Update the IoT Edge Agent's configuration

1. Edit the IoT Edge **config.yaml** file by entering the provisioning detail
    collected during the device instantiation step.

    `sudo vi /etc/iotedge/config.yaml`

    > [!WARNING]
    >YAML files cannot contain tabs as indentation. Use 2 spaces instead. Top-level items cannot have leading whitespace.

1. Scroll down until you see `# Manual provisioning configuration`. Comment out the next three lines as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    # Manual provisioning configuration
    #provisioning:
    #  source: "manual"
    #  device_connection_string: "<ADD DEVICE CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
    ```

1. Scroll down until you see `# DPS symmetric key provisioning configuration`. Uncomment the next eight lines as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    # DPS symmetric key provisioning configuration
    provisioning:
      source: "dps"
      global_endpoint: "https://global.azure-devices-provisioning.net"
      scope_id: "{scope_id}"
      attestation:
        method: "symmetric_key"
        registration_id: "{registration_id}"
        symmetric_key: "{symmetric_key}"
    ```

    - `registration_id` is the same as the Device ID.
    - `scope_id` is the scope from Azure IoT Central device connection.
    - `symmetric_key` is the Primary Key from Azure IoT Central device connection.

    If you don't have these values handy, you can get them
    from IoT Central.

    Save and quit the config.yaml file, Press Esc, and type **:wq!**

1. Restart IoT Edge to process your changes.

    ```bash
    systemctl restart iotedge
    ```

1. Type `iotedge list`. After a few minutes, you\'ll see five modules
deployed. You can keep running this command to check on status.

    Additionally, you can see the status for your modules in IoT Central for
the deployed IoT Edge Gateway

## Run the IoT Edge device and Monitor the deployment process

`systemctl restart iotedge`

Type `iotedge list`. After a few minutes, you\'ll see five modules
deployed. You can keep running this command to check on status.

Additionally, you can see the status for your modules in IoT Central for
the deployed IoT Edge Gateway

This [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot) has a guide to troubleshooting and diagnostics.

## Use the RTSP Simulator

As this template and code project is a reference design, we assume that
connecting a real network camera might not be feasible. The Public
Safety Template is instantiated with 2 simulated devices and follow
these instructions if you want to load a stream to your edge VM.

The following instructions enable using [Live555 Media Server](http://www.live555.com/mediaServer/) as a RTSP simulator in a docker container.

Run the **rtspvideo** in a docker container in the background to stream rstp
`docker run -d --name live555 --rm -p 554:554 mcr.microsoft.com/lva-utilities/rtspsim-live555:1.2`

Enumerate the docker containers

`docker ps`

Expect to see a container named live555
