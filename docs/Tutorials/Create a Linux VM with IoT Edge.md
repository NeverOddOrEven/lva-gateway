# Create a Linux VM with IoT Edge from the marketplace

## Overview

Azure IoT Edge is a fully managed service that delivers cloud intelligence locally by deploying and running

* Custom Logic
* Azure Services
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)

directly on cross-platform IoT devices. Run your IoT solution securely and at scaleâ€”whether in the cloud or offline.

This tutorial demonstrates what is involved in standing up an Azure IoT Edge enabled Linux VM on Azure Marketplace.

## Azure Market Place Offering

Use a preconfigured virtual machine to get started quickly, and easily automate and scale your IoT Edge testing.

This **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS** based virtual machine will install the latest Azure IoT Edge runtime and its dependencies on startup, and makes it easy to connect to your IoT Hub.

## Steps to Create VM

1. Click <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft_iot_edge.iot_edge_vm_ubuntu?tab=Overview" target="_blank">here</a> to deploy an Azure IoT Edge enabled Linux VM.

4. Provide Subscription details, resource group, password and SSH ports.

    Following are some sample values when creating the VM box.

    |Basics| |

    | Availability options|No infrastructure redundancy required |
    | Authentication type|Password |
    | UserName|\[Username\]|
    | Password|\*\*\* |
    | Public inbound ports|Allow Selected Ports SSH(22)|
    | Azure Spot|No|
    |**Disks**| |
    |OS disk type|Premium SSD
    |Use managed disks|Yes
    |Use ephemeral OS disk|No
    |**Networking**| |
    |Virtual network|(new) DV\_LVA\_RG\_EUS-vnet
    |Subnet|(new) default (10.0.0.0/24)
    |Public IP|(new) dvIoTEdgeLinux-ip
    |Accelerated networking|Off
    |Place this virtual machine behind an existing load balancing solution?|No
    |**Management**| |
    |Boot diagnostics                   |On
    |OS guest diagnostics               |Off
    |Azure Security Center              |None
    |Diagnostics storage account        |(new) dvlvargeusdiag
    |System assigned managed identity   |Off
    |Auto-shutdown                      |On
    |**Advanced**| |
    |Extensions                  |None
    |Cloud init                  |No
    |Proximity placement group   |None

5. Validation process happens and a web page is presented. Click **Create** button.

6. Deployment completes in around 3 minutes.

7. Click on **Go To Resource** button

8. Click on **Serial Console**

    :::image type="content" source="../media/Create a Linux VM with IoT Edge/07_connect_ssh.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Edge VM":::

9. A serial console on the portal browser will open. Press **Enter**. You will be prompted to enter User and Password. This is the username and password you setup during the Virtual Machine creation.

Connect this VM to your IoT Hub by setting the connection string with the run command feature (via Azure portal or command line interface) to execute:

[TODO: What command to execute?]

Update the IoT Edge security daemon and runtime to the latest.

[TODO: How to do this?]

Next, you will need to run the following commands as an administrator
(sudo):

`apt-get update`

`apt-get install libiothsm iotedge`

Verify the version on your device by using the command `iotedge version`.

The Lva Edge Gateway has been developed using version 1.0.9.

[TODO: When I installed the iotedge package, it's version is 1.0.8-2 and says it is the latest. Not sure how to get 1.0.9.]

## Update the IoT Edge Agent's configuration

Install the vim editor or use nano if preferred.

`apt-get install vim`

Edit the IoT Edge config.yaml file by entering the provisioning detail
collected during the device instantiation step.

`sudo vi /etc/iotedge/config.yaml`

1. Scroll down until you see `# Manual provisioning configuration`. Comment out the next three lines as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    # Manual provisioning configuration
    #provisioning:
    #  source: "manual"
    #  device_connection_string: "<ADD DEVICE CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
    ```

1. Scroll down until you see `# DPS symmetric key provisioning configuration`. Uncomment the next eight lines as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    # DPS symmetric key provisioning configuration
    provisioning:
      source: "dps"
      global_endpoint: "https://global.azure-devices-provisioning.net"
      scope_id: "{scope_id}"
      attestation:
        method: "symmetric_key"
        registration_id: "{registration_id}"
        symmetric_key: "{symmetric_key}"
    ```

> [!TIP]
> In the editor, ensure you don't leave a space before the word provisioning.

* `registration_id` is the same as the Device ID.
* `scope_id` is the scope from Azure IoT Central device connection.
* `symmetric_key` is the Primary Key from Azure IoT Central device connection.

If you don't have these values in your note editor, you can get them
from IoT Central.

To save and quit the config.yaml file, Press Esc, and type :wq!

Restart IoT Edge to process your changes.

`systemctl restart iotedge`

Type iotedge list. After a few minutes, you\'ll see five modules
deployed. You can keep running this command to check on status.

Additionally, you can see the status for your modules in IoT Central for
the deployed IoT Edge Gateway

## Run the IoT Edge device and Monitor the deployment process

\[Detail here\] docker and iotedge commands

## Use the RTSP Simulator using Live555 Media Server instead of a real camera

As this template and code project is a reference design, we assume that
connecting a real network camera might not be feasible. The Public
Safety Template is instantiated with 2 simulated devices and follow
these instructions if you want to load a stream to your edge VM.

The following instructions enable using [Live555 Media Server](http://www.live555.com/mediaServer/) as a RTSP simulator in a docker container.

Run the following command in the terminal:

[TODO: I get a permission denied error when trying to pull this image. Need to make sure this image is either public or indicate to user they need to be logged into the container registry]

`docker pull meshams.azurecr.io/rtspvideo`

Run the rtspvideo in a docker container in the background to stream rstp
`docker run -d --name live555 --rm -p 554:554 meshams.azurecr.io/rtspvideo`

Enumerate the docker containers

`docker ps`

Expect to see a container named live555
